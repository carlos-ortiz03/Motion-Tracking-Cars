# Motion-Tracking-Cars

## Background and Results of the Project 
I created this Project for my Computer Visions class back in the beginning to middle of October, and we utilized some pre-processing techniques such as Gaussian blur, which focuses on the center features more than everything else, creating more of a smoothed image. Furthermore, this was the last project we did before jumping into a bit of machine learning and the reason this project was a good transition toward that topic is that we are emphasizing that each image requires a different threshold and contour to identify only certain parts in an image, and that was very true, as I had to test my code many times until I decided on some parameters that did a decent job in identifying cars as a whole rather than specific features. However, there is still a bit of noise and error in certain images, but with the introduction of machine learning, we can train our models to have little to no error so that what happened with my images does not occur.
